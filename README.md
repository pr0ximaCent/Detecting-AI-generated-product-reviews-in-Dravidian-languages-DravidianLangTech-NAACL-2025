##Shared Task on Detecting AI generated product reviews in Dravidian languages: DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025
The "Shared Task on Detecting AI-generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages" aimed at addressing the growing concern of AI-generated product reviews, specifically in Dravidian languages, specifically in Malayalam and Tamil. As AI tools become more advanced, the ability to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content has become increasingly crucial, especially in the domain of online reviews where authenticity is essential for consumer decision-making. This shared task brings together researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate models that can accurately identify AI-generated reviews in these languages. Participants will work with datasets consisting of both human-written and AI-generated reviews, and the task will explore challenges unique to Dravidian languages.

The participants will be provided training and test dataset in Malayalam and Tamil languages. To download the data and participate, go to coda lab and click â€œParticipate" tab.

The evaluation of the models will be based on their F1 score, which is a common metric used in NLP to measure the performance of classification models. The shared task will be open to participants from around the world.
